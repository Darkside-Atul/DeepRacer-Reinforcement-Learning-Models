# DeepRacer Reinforcement Learning Models

Welcome to my collection of reinforcement learning models created for AWS DeepRacer! As part of my journey in RL and autonomous driving, I’ve developed these models to navigate a variety of racing tracks with a focus on balancing speed, accuracy, and adaptability.

## What’s Inside
- **Custom-Built Models**: Each model is tailored for specific track types and conditions, leveraging strategies that I've found effective through testing and tuning.
- **Experimentation with Hyperparameters**: I’ve explored a range of hyperparameters to optimize these models, documenting what worked and what didn’t to help others follow similar paths or make their own adjustments.

I hope this repository helps fellow RL enthusiasts as they explore and create. Enjoy diving into these models, and feel free to reach out with any questions or feedback!
